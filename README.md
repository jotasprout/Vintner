Information that can be tracked includes details on TA, pH, berry weight, cluster weight and count. In addition, specific treatments, additions and even tasting notes can be entered and tracked to the sub-block level. When a grower wants to add functionality, additional eSkye modules that include production, sales and distribution, and barrel tracking can be installed. ESkye also offers customized Internet-based portals designed to deliver improved communication and brand control for the winery. Pricing for eSkye's vineyard package only starts at about $5,000; additional functions and modules will, of course, increase that sum.
